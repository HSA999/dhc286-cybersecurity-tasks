# dhc286-cybersecurity-tasks
 Project Overview
This project involves setting up and testing the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) on a local PHP server to perform comprehensive web security assessments. The goal is to identify, analyze, and demonstrate common web vulnerabilities and explore mitigation strategies.

Objectives
Deploy DVWA on a local development environment using PHPâ€™s built-in server or a LAMP/WAMP stack.

Perform vulnerability scans using tools such as Nmap and Burp Suite.

Conduct manual penetration testing on typical web vulnerabilities, including but not limited to:

SQL Injection (SQLi)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

File Upload Vulnerabilities

Command Injection

Document identified vulnerabilities and propose practical remediation techniques.

Generate detailed security reports automatically and manually to assist in vulnerability management.

Project Components
Local Setup: Configuration of DVWA in a controlled environment for safe testing.

Scanning: Use of automated tools (Nmap for network scanning, Burp Suite for intercepting and manipulating HTTP requests).

Penetration Testing: Manual injection of payloads to exploit vulnerabilities and observe impacts.

Reporting: Compilation of results in clear, structured formats for review and assessment.
